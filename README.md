# Christmass
Christmass/Winter theme for BetterDiscord and OpenAsar. Based on Translucence.

### how to use?
1. BetterDiscord
 - download the file from the releases
 - copy the downloaded file(from the folder you downloaded it to)
 - go to settings > themes and click "Open Theme Folder"
 - paste the file there

2. OpenAsar
 - Copy code of the file "christmass.theme.css", or from the "code.css", cause it does the same thing, only one loads it from a website, the other doesnt
 - go to settings to the left corner to where there is "OpenAsar" and click on that "OpenAsar %version(without the "%")%" which opens the OpenAsar config
 - click the "Theming" and paste the code there and then click "restart"
